## Semantic Versioning 
Adding SemVer to our project. SemVer is a rule that shows the version of your projects: 
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)
As per this specification, any version number should be complying with this structure **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** where,

- **MAJOR** version is incremented when you make any breaking change
- **MINOR**  version is incremented when you add a new feature/functionality
- **PATCH** version is incremented when you make bug fixes
